So, I planned ahead by I contacting Scuba Views, to setup for two courses. I took the Padi Deep Diver course, as well as the Enriched Air course. When I arrived Bill had everything waiting for me, and was very professional. We did all our boat dives...\n\n\nMore', u'Chartered a dive with Scuba Views, Bill Duckro, Master ScubaDiver, Dive Master Levi and recently graduated to Scuba Diving Teacher Suzanne. 1st dive was at the Hoover Dam wall site, filled with various sizes of cement pieces, silt, sand, and zero mussels as well as varying size pinnacles that we dove over and thru. Bill was very helpful in guiding...\n\n\nMore', u'I travel widely and this is one of the best organised and equipped dive centres I have dived with. Quick and efficient shop administration and well equipped and practical dive boat. Sound operating procedures and caters well for junior divers.']}

They have some unique holes and the lighting adds some unique features. They even have a hole that keeps moving while you try to make it.', u'This place was awesome. Fan-freggin-tastic pizza and pretzels. Totally fun fluorescent/neon mini golf, arcade and laser tag. Unfortunately for me, the teenagers blew $40 in the arcade way too easily- guess they had too much fun and my pockets suffered.

It's pretty cheap at $9 per person for the first play through and $5 per person for more plays the same day.

My wife's glass of wine ($10 bottle) was )$18 a glass Came to see Rod Stuart and have a drink before. The $$ for Vegas even is just stupid. Save your money for a place that won't screw you over.", u'A haven of calm sophistication in the gaudiness of Vegas.
