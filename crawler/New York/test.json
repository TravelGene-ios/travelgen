It is an absolutely amazing park! Beautiful, clean and with lots of life\n", "\nThough it wasn't snowing, the Park was a perfect winter wonderland complete with squirrels and Christmas markets. A lovely easy morning activity taking in the sites.\n", "\nIt worth a visit 3 or 4 times a week. Everytime is changing. The Boat House is my favourite place in the park.\n", "\nNew York City, in general is so alive and Central Park is another artery in NYC that is no different.

Look at all the statues, see the Boat House, the Castle etc.\n", "\nOn January 23rd Central Park was a beauty to endure.

A place i can spend a lot of time at. There is too much to see and toomuch to listen.\n", "\nAwesome. I missed it last time I was in New York but so glad we visited this time. Easy to get to and free ....but we gave a donation cos these places need support to be able to share for generations\n", "\nAmazing collection of the most important people and artisrs from all over the world. They do not charge you to get in, but ask for a contribution in which you decide the value to donate. The Egyptian ward is unbelievable. WARNING! You will not be able to appreciate this beauty in only one visit.\n", "\nThere's a reason that this is the number one tourist attraction in New York City: it has something for everyone, adults and children with diverse interests. The quality of the collections is superb and they are artfully displayed. The space has a grandeur to it. The gifts shops are a delight. Even the guards are very respectful and circumspect.\n", "\nThis museum has something for everyone. I am one of those people who usually gets bored looking and wandering around at museums, but The Met truly is different.

We could have spent another full day here (should have come back rather than wasting a day at the MoMA the next day).\n", "\nWe spent the whole day seeing priceless beauty, fun, lively area, I have no idea how long it would take to cover the bulk of The Met.\nLots of entertainment on the front steps at lunchtime. Great sidewalk salesmen outside too.\n", "\nBuy far the Best Art Museum in the USA. From Europe to Egypt, Asia and North America, their exhibits exceed all expectations.\n", "\nDon't miss it even if you don't have a whole day or more. So much\nto see and learn, so little time -- even the building itself is a work of\nart.\n", "\nThere must be over a billion dollars of the most famous impressionist paintings in two rooms of the fourth floor. The rest of the fourth floor is amazing for lovers of French Impressionism\n"]},

Helpful and funny staff and a breathtaking view once at the top.\n", "\nthis one is worth the money. The views are incredible. You see the concrete jungle on one side and central park on the other. Better than empire state building i think.\n", "\nWe got tickets for this as a deal when we went to the MoMA. We went up after dinner and were impressed with the view of the city under a full moon.

We easily spent an hour up there looking...\n\n\nMore\u00a0 \n\n\n", "\nIf you're in doubt between the Empire States and this one and you have to choose one, go to the Top of the Rock. The view is just breathless. The best view of Central Park, which you can't see at the Empire States.\n", "\nIf you want romance and a ridiculously long wait on line with whoever your with this is what u wanna do.. it takes hours sometimes to get to the top buy a VIP ticket and do the ride in the building where you fly above nyc in a theatre prior to going to the observation deck that or slip the...\n\n\nMore\u00a0 \n\n\n"]}]
