And they have the most amazing crispy waffle fries...at a Korean wing place.... I know crazy', u"I finally stopped in, since it is in my neighborhood, and ordered the bulgogi. I honestly was not all that impressed, after all I have heard about this place. I wouldn't voluntarily go back there, but if someone were to offer a wing or two, I would most likely accept.", u'My daughter and I went to Dak on Saturday with my 2 \xbd year old grandson. The wings were everything we hoped for, crispy, huge, tender, flavorful, and filling. We also had bulgogi, which was tasty. I actually meant to order the BBQ pork bowl but messed up. My daughter and grandson loved it, so it was fine.

Hugo made us feel at home and is such a wonderfully warm welcoming personality. you will not be dissapointed dining here. Go try it! If you love Mexican food, I am positive you'll love La Ciudad!", u"From outside this small establishment can be easily overlooked. Nestled in a strip mall, with limited lighting this Mexican flair produced decent dishes for the price. I wouldn't bore you with the details I will highlight a few points.

Requirements: not too expensive, open on a Sunday after 4 pm; good food; parking. La Ciudad met and exceeded all the requirements.

In the last 2 1/2 years my husband and I have lived in Chicago, we've probably visited La Cuidad over 30 times. I'm not going to lie, the first time we went, I was a bit hesitant as it isn't in the best area.

Complete with Kosher food, it's deceiving because they share a building with a pharmacy, but one you're inside and consume all the smells you know you're in a real Deli.
